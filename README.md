**Project: Email Deliverability Health Dashboard (Synthetic Dataset)**

🔍 Overview

This project simulates the behavior of an email validation platform (like ZeroBounce) by building a predictive model and dashboard that assess the deliverability health of business email lists. The goal is to detect high-risk emails (bounce-prone, spam-trap flagged, low engagement) using engineered metadata and present insights in a clear, actionable format.

🎯 Objective

Predict bounce likelihood using classification models.

Score emails based on deliverability factors (domain trust, engagement rate, spam risk).

Visualize domain-level risks and key engagement trends.

Simulate a business case for improving email list hygiene.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Seaborn)

Power BI / Tableau (Dashboard visualization)

Synthetic Dataset (Generated using Python – realistic but non-identifiable)

Optional Add-ons: XGBoost, Dash/Streamlit, GitHub Pages for demo

📦 Dataset Summary

Size: 10,000 records

Fields:

email_id, domain

open_rate, click_rate

has_spammy_words, num_links, html_email

past_bounce, spam_trap_flag

Target: bounce_likelihood (0 = low, 1 = high)

Note: All data is synthetically generated to mirror realistic behavioral and technical patterns without compromising user privacy.

🔍 Key Features & Engineering Logic

Engagement Features: Open and click rate thresholds simulate active vs. dormant users.

Spam Risk Flags: Words like “free,” “buy now,” or links >5 indicate potential spam behavior.

Domain Trust Heuristics: Custom mapping (e.g., gmail.com = low risk, tempmail.net = high risk).

Bounce Label Logic: Based on combination of past bounces, spam trap flags, and engagement.

🧠 Machine Learning Approach

Binary classification model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost)

Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

Confusion matrix and feature importance analysis

📊 Dashboard Components

Domain-wise bounce risk heatmap

High-risk segment summary

Spam score distribution

Engagement vs. Bounce cluster chart

Recommendations panel (e.g., "Remove emails with spammy words + 0% engagement")

📘 What This Project Shows

Real-world thinking: Simulates what email hygiene tools do behind the scenes.

Practical ML skills: End-to-end data cleaning, modeling, and evaluation.

Communication: Clear dashboard with storytelling to support business decisions.

🧩 Next Steps

Add NLP-based subject line risk scoring.

Deploy on Streamlit for demo interaction.
